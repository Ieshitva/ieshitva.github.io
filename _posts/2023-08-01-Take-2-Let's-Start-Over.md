I visited Maldives in 2019. I described it as a changing experience in my life.
And here I am again, 4 years older, revisiting the same place and retracing my own footsteps.<br/>

For most of my twenties, I had subscribed to a very nihilistic view of life. That nothing matters and It’s all going to pass is what spearheaded my actions. Consequently, I put in the work but attached no meaning to anything, and as a result, I couldn’t shake this feeling that my life was going by on autopilot.</b>


After getting back to India, I had the luck of collaborating with some of my teachers, whom I hold in high regard, on a research project close to my heart. I cleared my medical exams soon after. I served during the pandemic. I saw the delicate interplay of life and death up close at what I still consider to be a young age. Lost a friend to the pandemic. Rekindled some friendships that shouldn’t have been let go. Worked to progress artificial intelligence in health. Got published. Got out of a toxic relationship. Learnt the intricacies of world finance. Learnt a thing or two about music. Grew my hair long, then cut it short and now watching them grow grey while I pack and prepare to say goodbye to my homeland.</b>


So now here I am again. Back to where it started. A full circle of 4 years. I understand how insignificant one life can seem in the grandiosity of the universe, and yet the universe is nothing but a collection of these seemingly ‘insignificant’ lives. And it generously gives us many do-overs.
The footprints I made 4 years ago are gone, just as the footprints I made today will be someday. But a lot can happen in the seemingly insignificant time they last—at least that's what I choose to believe now.</b>


Here’s to failing upward, being humble, and being kind. For some footprints echo through eternity, forever imprinted on the souls of those we hate and love, keeping you alive through space and time.</b>

Till next time. Cheers!</b>
