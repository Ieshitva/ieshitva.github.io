I think when I first thought of starting a blog, I had privacy in my mind. We live in a world of ignorance. Humans are great at denying stuff. Keep us long in a situation and we’ll keep moving ignoring the fact that something wrong even exists. Look at what’s going on in Hong Kong and ask your friends what’s their opinion of the situation is, and you’ll understand what I mean to say. 

Similarly, this whole scene of facebook and Google, basically the 5 big companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and Micrsoft) recording your data and using it, mainly without your permission for their own purpose disturbed me. Sure you don’t have anything to hide but does that mean you will agree to live in a house made of glass where you undress to prying eyes ? Absolutely not. That’s the reason I quit Facebook/Instagram, largely replaced WhatsApp with Telegram and Signal, limited use of Google services, set up NextCloud as my own cloud space replacing Google Drive and OneDrive and moving more and more towards open source software.
This blog serves as my own place. I own the data I post 

Another thing that fascinates me is going back to the roots of internet.
Before the advent of social platforms, we had individual webpages where the person owned a site, posted stuff and people who actually wanted to read, visited the webpage. Everything was done to pass on information without either party thinking of 'likes' and 'hearts'. I want to visit that time again with this website. I want to put my views, have meaningful discussions. Having my own exclusive space eliminates the thought of getting most upvotes and hitting popularity within confines of a virtual ecosystem.

I don’t intend to write huge journalistic articles. That’s not my intention here on blog. Though I’d be glad if my posts encourage you to dig deeper and uncover facts on your own. I intend to write my thoughts on world and personal events here and what I think of them. After all that’s the point of a personal blog isn’t it ?

Coming back to privacy issues with Facebook, you can start with the following links and look up for more on the internet. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/14/facebook-privacy-problems-roundup">Take a look here.

Your data is used to train Artificial Intelligence. How ?
suppose you Google stuff before exams. Look up some medical terms and procedures. Simple. Harmless searches. Right ?
Google then figures that there is a surge of similar searches in one particular college. Using it's machine learning and AI it predicts there is an exam coming up next day. Based on your searches it predicts how intelligent you are. Predicts how much you'll score. Predicts how successful you'll eventually be in long term. This all is confirmed by your posts on Facebook. 

So what’s the harm ?
Well for one example, they track your political opinions. Track what is it that you complain most about on FB Insta, WhatsApp. Then compile data. Share it with political leaders visiting your constituency who use it to highlight issues I'm their speech to impress the local people. This is just one example. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Read more here.

Such data was used in both Indian and US presidential elections.

Consequences are beyond what we think of. We just know when they finally materialise. I have just chosen not to participate. You have access to all the facts on this matter widely available on internet. You can decide what to do with it but as far as I have understood, people need drastic examples to shake them off their apathy and in present world where you are constantly bombarded with news from all directions, it’s hard to focus on what matters and it has become easy to read and move on.
