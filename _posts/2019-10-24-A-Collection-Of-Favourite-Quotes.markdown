An ever updating, exhaustive list of my favourite quotes over the years with my personal take to them.



<b>A is A</b>
-Law of Identity

Ah! Starting with my personal favourite. Has been my got to quote for years. What is, is. There is no point whining about probelms, situations and circumstances. What is, is. Invest your time making best of them instead.


<b>We can evade reality, but we cannot evade the consequences of evading reality.</b>
-Ayn Rand

Another classic. You can have arguments, you can have opinions and you may choose to mold reality to suit your comfort but ultimately evading truth doesn't get you too far. The repurcussions of turning a blind eye to reality of life ultimately catches up. You cna choose to neglect privacy issues today, you may choose to turn blind to suppression of human rights in other parts of world today but it all ultimately catches up and affects you one way or the other some day.


<b>I'm sure this goes against everything you've been tuaght, but right and wrong do exist.
Just because you don't know what the right answer is...maybe there's even no way you could know what the right answer is...doesn't make your answer right or even okay.
It's much simpler than that.
It's just plain wrong.</b>
-Dr.House|House M.D.


<b>Well, that's the problem with life, right ?
Either you know what you want and then you don't get what you want...
...or you get what you want and then you don't know what you want.</b>
-Diane Ngyuen|Bojack Horseman


It gets easier.
Everyday it gets a little easier.
But you gotta do it everyday. That's the hard part. But it does get easier.
-Bojack Horseman


<b>To live is to risk it all.
Otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.</b>
-Rick Sanchez|Rick & Morty


<b>When you know nothing matters the universe is yours, and I've never met a universe that was into it.
The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them.
Smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it will never stop trying to throw you and eventually it will.
There’s no other way off.</b>
-Rick Sanchez|Rick & Morty
