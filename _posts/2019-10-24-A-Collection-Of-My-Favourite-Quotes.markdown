<p>An ever updating, exhaustive list of my favourite quotes over the years with my personal take on them.</p>
<br/>


<p><blockquote><b>A is A</b>-Law of Identity</blockquote>

Ah! Starting with my personal favourite. Has been my go to quote for years. What is, is. There is no point whining about problems, situations and circumstances. What is, is. Invest your time making best of them instead.</p>
<br/>

<p><blockquote><b>We can evade reality, but we cannot evade the consequences of evading reality.</b>-Ayn Rand</blockquote>

Another classic. You can have arguments, you can have opinions and you may choose to mold reality to suit your comfort but ultimately evading truth doesn't get you too far. The repercussions of turning a blind eye to reality of life ultimately catches up. You can choose to neglect internet privacy issues today, you may choose to turn blind to suppression of human rights in other parts of world today but it all ultimately catches up and affects you one way or the other sooner or later.</p>

<p><blockquote><b>I'm sure this goes against everything you've been taught, but right and wrong do exist.<br/>
Just because you don't know what the right answer is...maybe there's even no way you could know what the right answer is...doesn't make your answer right or even okay.<br/>
It's much simpler than that.<br/>
It's just plain wrong.</b>-House M.D.</blockquote></p>

<br/>

<p><blockquote><b>Well, that's the problem with life, right ?<br/>
Either you know what you want and then you don't get what you want...<br/>
...or you get what you want and then you don't know what you want.</b>-Bojack Horseman</blockquote></p>
<br/>


<p><blockquote><b>It gets easier.<br/>
Everyday it gets a little easier.<br/>
But you gotta do it everyday. That's the hard part. But it does get easier.</b>-Bojack Horseman</blockquote></p>
<br/>


<p><blockquote><b>To live is to risk it all.<br/>
Otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.</b>-Rick & Morty</blockquote></p>
<br/>



<p><blockquote><b>When you know nothing matters the universe is yours, and I've never met a universe that was into it.<br/>
The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them.<br/>
Smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it will never stop trying to throw you and eventually it will.<br/>
Thereâ€™s no other way off.</b>-Rick & Morty</blockquote></p>
